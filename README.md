# 1010 Sequence Detector (Mealy Machine) ‚Äì Verilog

This project implements a **1010 sequence detector** using a **Mealy finite state machine (FSM)** in Verilog. The output is asserted (`out = 1`) **as soon as the input sequence "1010" is detected**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Input**: Serial binary input (`in`)
- **Output**: A signal (`out`) which becomes `1` when the sequence `1010` is detected
- **Clock**: The FSM transitions on the **rising edge** of `clk`
- **Reset**: Active-low asynchronous reset (`rst`)

### ‚ûø State Transitions:

- `S0` ‚Üí Initial state
- `S1` ‚Üí After receiving `1`
- `S2` ‚Üí After receiving `10`
- `S3` ‚Üí After receiving `101`
- When `0` is received in `S3`, the full sequence `1010` is matched, and `out` is asserted.

## üß™ Simulation Instructions

1. Use any Verilog simulator such as:
   - ModelSim
   - Xilinx Vivado
   - Icarus Verilog with GTKWave

2. To compile and run using Icarus Verilog:
   ```
   iverilog -o seq_detector sequence_detector_1010.v sequence_detector_1010_tb.v
   vvp seq_detector
   ```
### üìä To View Waveform

Add the following snippet inside your testbench:
```
initial begin
    $dumpfile("wave.vcd");
    $dumpvars(0, sequence_detector_1010_tb);
end

```

Then run the simulation and open the waveform using GTKWave:

```
iverilog -o seq_detector sequence_detector_1010.v sequence_detector_1010_tb.v
vvp seq_detector
gtkwave wave.vcd
```
